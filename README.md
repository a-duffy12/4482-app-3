# 4482-app-3 - BOOM
 
 **Goal**
 The goal of BOOM is to complete all the levels. Each levels pits the player against a variety of enemies in a map. The player has a variety of weapons and abilities at their disposal. Levels are completed by eliminating all enemies in the level. Dying in a level will gracefully restart it.
 
 **How to Play**
 Run the BOOM.exe executable. This will open the game to the main menu. Note that all game progress and settings are saved, so feel free to close the game at any point.
 
 **Menu**
 The menu has four buttons. Play will take you to whichever level you are currently on. Levels will open a menu to allow you to replay completed levels. Options will open a settings menu. Quit will quit the game.
 
 **Options**
 Here you can change your settings. This menu is also accessible during the game via the pause menu. The game difficulty has four settings of increasing difficulty (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Fun). The difference between these difficulties is simply the amount of damage enemies do to you. FOV is your player field of view, controlling how much you see around you. Sensitivity is how quickly your crosshair moves based on your mouse's movement. Your crosshair color can be switched between red, green, blue, and purple. Gore (enemeis explode into guts) can be toggled on and off. A framerate (FPS) counter can be toggled on and off. All game keybind controls can be rebound to whatever buttons you desire.
 
 **Controls**
 WASD controls movement. Mouse movement controls your crosshair and player camera. Space jumps. Shift dashes (burst of speed in movement direction). C crouches (enemies cannot detect you from as far, but you are slower). Left click shoots your active gun. Right click zooms in the sniper. Q uses the rewind ability. F throws a grenade. E uses your knife. 1 switches to your assault rifle,. 2 switches to your shotgun. 3 switches to your sniper. 4 switches to your flamethrower. Escape pauses the game. Tab toggles the HUD on and off. All of these can be changed from the options and pause menus.
